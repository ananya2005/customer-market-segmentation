# Customer Market Segmentation

Machine Learning applications are unlocking value across business functions. 
This project deals with Customer Market Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning Models.
It is crucial for maximizing marketing campaign conversion rate. This can be achieved by targeted marketing that is tailored to a specific group of customers.

The unsupervised learning models used in this project are K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis(PCA).

# K-means Clustering:

K-Means clustering works by grouping observations with similar attribute values together by measuring the distance between the data points. For this project, I have
used Euclidean Distance. Identifying the optimal number of clusters, i.e, 'K' can be tricky. This has been addressed by using the Elbow Method.
